# Kunle Adesokan's Portfolio

Welcome to the codebase for my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my work as a Full-Stack Developer, highlighting my skills, recent projects, and core values as I pursue opportunities in front-end, full-stack, and software engineering.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This website serves as a central hub for my professional online presence, built to reflect my experience and personality through interactive design, smooth user experience, and performant code. It’s built with modern web technologies to ensure responsiveness, accessibility, and fast load times.

### Project Structure

The portfolio project is organized into versioned directories (e.g., v1, v2), allowing iterative improvements over time while maintaining the history of each major iteration.

- **Current Version**: v1

- Backend: Node.js and Express (for potential API and integrations)
- Styling: CSS Modules for scoped styles and theming (Tailwind CSS for future versions)
- Animations: CSS and JavaScript for smooth transitions and interactive elements
- Hosting: Will be deployed on Netlify
